    Hello. I live in San Francisco with my life partner, Steven Simoni. I like working on different projects with my <a href=''>friends</a> Lately, I have been working on a personalized medicine app called myface. My husband and I started working on it together because his forward always had acne from the stress of working on <a href="https://bbot.menu">Bbot</a>, a drink delivery system for bars and restaurants.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here are some things I liked in 2017: The Florida Project, Vice Principles, Stranger Things, Fargo and Get Out; watching Cloud 9 in League of Legends in between programming sessions; and consuming a bunch of podcasts.
