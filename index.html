    Hello. I live in San Francisco with my life partner, Steven Simoni. Lately, I have been working on a personalized medicine app called myface (working title). My husband and I started working on it together because his forward always had acne from the stress of working on <a href="https://bbot.menu">Bbot</a>, a drink delivery system for bars and restaurants.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here are some things I liked in 2017: Bikram Yoga, The Crown, and taking Loki on epic hikes.

    <strong>Interests</strong></br>
    Biotech communications. Healthcare communications. Participating in community gatherings. <a href='https://bbot.menu'>Helping Steven with Bbot</a>. Hanging out with my dog Loki.
